# Instructions
Given you have tModLoader installed, all you have to do is open the executible in the *dist* file to start the program (recommend to male a shortcut if you want it in a different location).

All it does is give you the option to select a modpack that you want to start your tModLoader server with if you so choose. After that, the start-tModLoader.bat file opens with the selected mods enabled for the server. Follow the instructions from there.
